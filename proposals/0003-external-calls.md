## Introduction

Contracts can be created "from outside" via Ethereum transactions or from within Flint Contracts. They contain persistent data in state variables and functions that can modify these variables. Calling a function on a different contract (instance) will perform an EVM Function call and thus switch the context such that state variables in the old context are inaccessible.

## Motivation
Calls to untrusted contracts can introduce several unexpected risks and errors.

When the internal contract calls to an external contract (i.e. the callee contract) the callee  may execute, potentially malicious, but always arbitrary code.
This code can itself include external calls to any other contract. Which themselves allow arbitrary code execution and so on.

As such, **every** external call should be treated as a security risk because it requires the integrity of every contract in this chain.

However external calls are necessary to accomplish key features of smart contracts, including:
- Paying other users
- Interacting with other Contracts e.g. Tokens or Wallets

There have been several published best practice guidelines for programming with external calls ([Consensys Recommendations](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls), [OpenZeppelin](http://openzeppelin.org/), [Solium Security](https://github.com/duaraghav8/solium-plugin-security), [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril), [Solcheck](https://github.com/federicobond/solcheck)). This proposal will integrate best practice into the language design. Below are causes for concern with external calls.

#### 1. Contracts are untrustworthy by default
```javascript
// bad
Bank.withdraw(100); // Unclear whether trusted or untrusted

function makeWithdrawal(uint amount) { // Isn't clear that this function is potentially unsafe
    Bank.withdraw(amount);
}

// good
UntrustedBank.withdraw(100); // untrusted external call
TrustedBank.withdraw(100); // external but trusted bank contract maintained by XYZ Corp

function makeUntrustedWithdrawal(uint amount) {
    UntrustedBank.withdraw(amount);
}
```

#### 2. External calls have arbitrary code execution
Examples of problems that can arise in Solidity code due to this code execution include:
##### Re-entrancy

```swift
contract HoneyPot {
  var balances: [Address: Int]
}
HoneyPot :: caller <- (any) {
  @payable
  public init() {
    put()
  }

  @payable
  public put(implicit value: Wei) {
    balances[caller] = value.rawValue
  }

  public func get() {
    // START OF SOLIDITY SYNTAX
    if (!caller.call.value(balances[caller])()) {
      throw;
    }
    // END OF SOLIDITY SYNTAX
    balances[caller] = 0
  }
}
```

`HoneyPot` contract sets the value of the address balance to zero only after checking if sending ether to `caller` goes through.

What if there is an `AttackContract` that tricks `HoneyPot` into thinking that it still has ether to withdraw before `AttackContract` balance is set to zero. This can be done in a recursive manner and the name for this is called reentrancy attack. It does this by calling `get()` inside of the `fallback` function. This unnamed function is called whenever the `AttackContract` receives ether.

This illustrates how easily control flow can be hijacked due to external calls.

**Solidity Workaround**

`someAddress.send()` and `someAddress.transfer()` in Solidity are considered safe against reentrancy. While these methods still trigger code execution, the called contract is only given a stipend of `2300 gas` which is currently only enough to log an event.
- Prevents reentrancy but is incompatible with any contract whose fallback function requires 2300 gas or more.
- Sometimes the programmer won't want this, but then has to fall back onto the dangerous raw calls.

#### 3. External calls can silently fail
Solidity offers low-level call methods that work on rawAddress: `address.call()`, `address.callcode()`, `address.delegatecall()`, `address.send()`. These low-level methods never throw an exception so they fail silently.

The following are examples of pre-exisiting solutions for external calls in solidity.
```javascript
// fails silently
someAddress.send(55);
// this is doubly dangerous, as it will forward all remaining gas and doesn't check for result
someAddress.call.value(55)();
// if deposit throws an exception, the raw call() will only return false and transaction will NOT be reverted
someAddress.call.value(100)(bytes4(sha3("deposit()")));

// good
if(!someAddress.send(55)) {
    // Some failure code
}

ExternalContract(someAddress).deposit.value(100);
```

#### 4. Interfaces can easily be incorrectly specified
Minor errors in interfaces may lead to wrong code being executed. For instance, if you specified a function `set(uint)` in the contract `Alice` that takes an `uint` in the contract `Bob` but in the actual contract `Alice` the function is `set(int)`.
The two will produce different method IDs. As a result, `Bob` will call the fallback function of `Alice` rather than of `set`. As when Alice's function is called it can't find a matching function.

 This type of error is responsible for the bug in [King of the Ether](https://www.kingoftheether.com/postmortem.html) (line numbers:
	[100](https://github.com/kieranelby/KingOfTheEtherThrone/blob/master/contracts/KingOfTheEtherThrone.sol#L100),
	[107](https://github.com/kieranelby/KingOfTheEtherThrone/blob/master/contracts/KingOfTheEtherThrone.sol#L107),
	[120](https://github.com/kieranelby/KingOfTheEtherThrone/blob/master/contracts/KingOfTheEtherThrone.sol#L120),
	[161](https://github.com/kieranelby/KingOfTheEtherThrone/blob/master/contracts/KingOfTheEtherThrone.sol#L161))

## Proposed solution
The following solution is partially based upon the [Command Design Pattern](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/command) and the [Oraclize Engine's](https://docs.oraclize.it/) implementation of calls to the internet.

The solution is designed to allow for execution of the argument if and only if other given conditions are met. For instance that the gas provided is sufficient for the call, or the function accepts ether.

A valid external call should specify the following, some of these can be auto-filled by the compiler:
- The contract address
- The function name
- The parameters
- The gas allocation
- The ether allocation

Our motivations are:
1. Contracts are untrustworthy by default;
2. Arbitrary code may get executed;
3. Failures may be silent;
4. Interfaces may be incorrectly specified.

We separate external calls into two types: _Trusted Calls_ and _Distrusted Calls_. Trusted calls are those accessed through the Flint Package Manager or those which Flint has the source files for and deploys internally to the contract, i.e. Hub and Spoke Topology. Distrusted calls are those with an ABI interface or Trait interface.

Distrusted calls (1) should be visually flagged in the source language as dangerous. Using a bang (!) would be consistent with the attempt call syntax for forcing a call without all information. In order to make a call we should specify the parameters for the call and to provide flexibility the default parameters should be at their minimum values. For instance the default gas provided should be 2300 (the amount given for just sending ether) with an option to send all gas.

Trusted calls meanwhile are not guaranteed to not introduce errors, but they have certain guarantees attached. These means that it means motivations (1), (2), (4) are resolved:
1. That there is a defined function at the end of the call
2. That function obeys the modifiers given
3. That function has the same return types and parameter types as defined
4. The contract you call matches the source code given
5. The gas provided should be inferred by gas estimation over flint

We propose a method to both declare this interface within Flint, use the The Flint Package Manager to extract an interface, or call contracts distrusted.

In _Distrusted Calls_, the contract, sets the properties of the director which then sets up the command which is finally sent to the contract.
```          
                                   | |   +----------+
+----------+        +----------+   |C|   |          |
| Contract |------->| Director |-->|O|==>| External |
+----------+        +----------+   |D|   | Contract |
                                   |E|   |          |
                                   | |   +----------+
```

By encapsulating the request within an object - `Director`, thereby letting Flint make external calls to arbitrary contracts, with arbitrary structures and hyper-parameters generic.

(3) is combated by having necessary catching of all external calls - or prefixing with `try!` and `try?` to revert and nullify respectively.

### Distrusted Calls
#### Interface specified
```swift
interface Alpha(State1, State2) {
  var owner: Address

  Alpha @(State1) :: (any) {
    func doesNothing()
  }
  Alpha @(any) :: (owner) {
    func doesNothingWithArgs(Int, Int, Int)
    func withdraw() -> Int
    func deposit(Int) -> Bool
  }
  Alpha @(any) :: (any) {
    @payable
    func expensiveFunction()
  }
}

let alpha: Director<Alpha> = 0x000... with Alpha

try alpha!.doesNothing() then {
  // Successful Call
} catch {
  // If it fails
}
try! alpha!.doesNothingWithArgs(x, y, z)
// Catch can not be provided by using try!, then if the call fails then transaction reverts.

try! alpha!.withdraw() // This flags an error as the return value is not dealt with

try! boundReturn <- alpha!.withdraw() then {
  // Optionally does something with boundReturn
}

// Setting hyper parameters //
// Asset types are atomically transferred to preserve special properties.
alpha!.transfer(Wei(200))
alpha!.allocate(Gas(2000))
alpha.trust() // Removes the need for a bang
try! alpha.expensiveFunction()
```

### Trusted Calls

#### Flint Package Manager
```swift
// Creates a contract from the data stored in Flint Package Manager
import flint://0x000... as ERCToken

ERCToken.transfer(...)
```
#### Source Code
A contract's source code can be imported by:
- Directly downloading its source files
- Providing a web URL
- Finding the Flint contract in the (future) Flint Package Manager

```swift
import https://flint.org/examples/contract.flint as URLContract
import FileContract
import Directory.Contract

let contract: Contract<URLContract> = deploy(URLContract)
contract.argumentName() // Value and Gas are automatically set based upon properties
```

### ABI
Behind the scenes all of these interfaces are decoded into ABI function calls. [ABI Specification](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/abi-spec.html)
```
"dave", true and [1,2,3]

```

## Semantics
- Calls with value have payable modifier
- Return values must be checked
- Avoid multiple external calls in single transaction. External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately
- Critical functions such as sends with non-zero values or suicide() are callable by anyone or sender is compared to address that can be writtent to by anyone
- Payable transaction doesn't revert in the case of failure

### Warnings
#### Warn on "effects" after "interactions"
If the contract storage is changed after an external call then a warning should be emitted. This should encourage two things:
1. `checks-effects-interactions` pattern
2. `Pull over push` for external calls. This is considered a [best practice](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls) as it helps isolate each external call into its own transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call.


```javascript
// Without push-pull
function bid() payable {
    if (highestBidder != 0) {
        highestBidder.transfer(highestBid); // if this call consistently fails, no one else can bid
    }

   highestBidder = msg.sender;
   highestBid = msg.value;
}

// With push-pull
mapping(address => uint) refunds;

function bid() payable external {
    require(msg.value >= highestBid);

    if (highestBidder != 0) {
      // Push: record the refund that this user can claim
      refunds[highestBidder] += highestBid;
      // Could also emit an event as an Asynchronous trigger for the previous bidder to withdrawRefund
    }

    highestBidder = msg.sender;
    highestBid = msg.value;
}

function withdrawRefund() external {
    uint refund = refunds[msg.sender];
    refunds[msg.sender] = 0;
    msg.sender.transfer(refund);
}
```


## Possible future extensions

### Named Arguments
```swift
func func2() {
  func1({key: 3, value: 2})
}
```

### Automatic event emission
```
var newExternalCall: Event<to: Address, description: String>
```


## Alternatives considered
### Blind Calls
This acts as a direct translation to the ABI that gets called behind the scenes. This gives a low-level interface to the contract but is also highly prone to error.
```swift
func callFoo(contractAddress: Address) {
  contractAddress.call(bytes4(sha3("foo(uint256)")), a)
}
```

### Variable binding
Results could also be bound to variables instead of an identifier
```swift
let boundReturn: Int = try! alpha!.withdraw()

try let boundReturn: Int = alpha!.withdraw then {
  // Use bound return
}
```

### Guard-like syntax
We could flip the catching of the call so you only specify the catch statement after it then continue code execution as normal. This would reduce the indentation of the language, but would then not match the if statement syntax.

```swift
let alpha: Director<Alpha> = 0x000... with Alpha

try alpha!.doesNothing() else {
  // If it fails
}
// If it succeeds execution will continue

try! boundReturn <- alpha!.withdraw()
// Optionally does something with boundReturn
```

### Parameters of the call are appended
Calls need information such as the amount of gas to allocate or the Ether value to transfer. This contradicts the return type as: `address.foo` is of type `Void` and so must `address.foo.value(10)` be but `.value()` is not a property of the `Void` type. This means special cases would be needed for the type checker, and is just generally confusing.
```swift
contract A {
  @payable
  public func foo(i: Int){
    // ...
  }
}

func callData(address: Address) {
  address.foo.value(10).gas(800)(5)
}
```

### Call Specification
This was rejected because it confuses both the function name, the arguments and the hyper parameters for the call. They are all assigned together.
```swift
call Name {
  let name: String = "foo"
  let arg1: Int = 5
  let value: Wei = 10
  let gas: Gas = 800
}
```
