Flint is a new type-safe, capabilities-secure, contract-oriented programming language specifically designed for writing robust smart contracts on Ethereum.

## Documentation

The [Flint Programming Language Guide](https://franklinsch.gitbooks.io/flint/) gives a high-level overview of the language, and helps you getting started with smart contract development in Flint.

## Contributing

Contributions to Flint are highly welcomed!
The Issues page tracks the tasks which have yet to be completed.

## Future plans

Future plans for Flint are numerous, and include:

1. **Gas estimation**: provide estimates about the gas execution cost of a function. Gas upper bounds are emitted as part of the contract's interface, making it possible to obtain the estimation of a call to an external Flint function.
2. **Formalization**: specify well-defined semantics for the language.
3. **The Flint Package Manager**: create a package manager which records contract APIs as well as safety and gas cost information of dependencies, aka _Flint stones_.
4. **Tooling**: build novel tools around smart contract development, such as new ways of simulating and visualizing different transaction orderings.

## License

The Flint project is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more information.
