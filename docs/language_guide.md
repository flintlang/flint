# Setup
---

## Installation
## Docker
The Flint compiler and its dependencies can be installed using Docker:
```
Docker pull franklinsch/flint
docker run -i -t franklinsch/flint
```
Example smart contracts are available in `/flint/examples/valid/`.

## Binary Packages and Building from Source
### Dependencies

#### Swift
The Flint compiler is written in Swift, and requires the Swift compiler to be installed, either by:
- Mac only: Installing Xcode (recommended)
- Mac/Linux: Using `swiftenv`
  1. Install swiftenv: `brew install kylef/formulae/swiftenv`
  2. Run `swiftenv install 4.1`

#### Solc
Flint also requires the Solidity compiler to be installed:

**Mac**
```
brew update
brew upgrade
brew tap ethereum/ethereum
brew install solidity
```
**Linux**
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install solc
```

### Binary Packages
Flint is compatible on macOS and Linux platforms, and can be installed by downloading a built binary directly.

The latest releases are available at https://github.com/franklinsch/flint/releases.


### Building From Source
The best way to start contributing to the Flint compiler, `flintc`, is to clone the GitHub repository and build the project from source.

Once you have the `swift` command line tool installed, you can build `flintc`.
```
git clone https://github.com/franklinsch/flint.git
cd flint
make
```
The built binary is available at `.build/debug/flintc`.

Add `flintc` to your PATH using:
```
export PATH=$PATH:.build/debug/flintc
```

**Using Xcode**

If you have Xcode on your Mac, you can use Xcode to contribute to the compiler.

You can generate an Xcode project using:
```
swift package generate-xcodeproj
open flintc.xcodeproj
```

---
## Syntax Highlighting
Syntax highlighting for Flint source files can be obtained through several editors, including:
### Vim
By running the following command in the flint repository vim will now have syntax highlighting.
```
ditto utils/vim ~/.vim
```
### Atom
The `language-flint` package can be downloaded to have syntax highlighting for flint files.

---
## Compilation
Flint compiles to EVM bytecode, which can be deployed to the Ethereum blockchain using a standard client, or Truffle.

For testing purposes, the recommended way of running a contract is by using the Remix IDE.

### Using Remix
Remix is an online IDE for testing Solidity smart contracts. Flint contracts can also be tested in Remix, by compiling Flint to Solidity.

In this example, we are going to compile and run the `Counter` contract, available to download [here](https://github.com/franklinsch/flint/blob/master/examples/valid/counter.flint).

#### Compiling
A Flint source file named `counter.flint` containing a contract `Counter` can be compiled to a Solidity file using:
```
flintc main.flint --emit-ir
```
You can view the generate code, embedded as a Solidity program:
```
cat bin/main/Counter.sol
```
Example smart contracts are available in the repository, under `examples/valid`.

#### Interacting with contract in Remix
To run the generated Solidity file on Remix:

1. Copy the contents of  `bin/main/Counter.sol` and paste the code in Remix.

1. Press the red Create button under the Run tab in the right sidebar.

1. You should now see your deployed contract below. Click on the copy button on the right of `Counter` to copy the contract's address.

1. Select from the dropdown right above the Create button and select `_InterfaceMyContract`.

1. Paste in the contract's address in the "Load contract from Address" field, and press the At Address button.

1. You should now see the public functions declared by your contract (`getValue`, `set`, and `increment`). Red buttons indicate the functions are mutating, whereas blue indicated non-mutating.

You should now be able to call the contract's functions.

# Core Features
---

## Constants and Variables
Constants and Variables associate a name with a value of a particular type. The value of a constant can't be changed once it's set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.

### Declaring Constants and Variables
You declare constants with the `let` keyword and variables with the `var` keyword.

Flint is a typed language and as such every variable and constant should be annotated with a type. A type annotation places a colon after the name. To see what types are built-in see [Types](#types).

```swift
let maxValues: Int = 10
var currentValue: Int = 0
```

A colon can be thought of as "... of type ...", so the code above can be read as:

Declare a constant called `maxValues` that is of type `Int` with the value 10.

You can change the value of an existing variable to another value of a compatible type. For example the currentValue can be incremented.
```swift
var currentValue: Int = 4
currentValue = 0
```
Unlike a variable, the value of a constant can't be changed after it's set.
```swift
let languageName = "Flint"
languageName = "f" // This a compile-time error
```
---

## Literals
_Literals_ represent fixed values in source code that can be assigned to constants and variables.
- Integer (`Int`) literals can be written as decimal numbers e.g. `42`.
- Address (`Address`) literals are written as 40 hexadecimal digits prefixed by a `0x`
- Boolean (`Bool`) literals are simply `true` and `false`.
- List (`[T]` or `T[n]`) literals are of the form:
  - `[]` which defines a new empty List
  - In the future, we will have lists defined by `[x, y, z, ...]` where `x`, `y`, `z` etc. are literals of type `T`
- Dictionary (`[T: U]`) literals are of the form:
  - `[:]` which defines a new empty Dictionary
  -  In the future, we will have dictionary literals defined by `[x: a, y: b, z: c, ...]` where `x`, `y`, `z` are literals of type `T` and `a`, `b`, `c` are literals of type `U`

---

## Comments
Comments can be used to exclude text from your code. Comments are ignored by the compiler when compiled.

```swift
// This is a comment
```

---

## Operators
An operator is a special symbol used to check, change, or combine values. Flint supports most standard C operators and attempts to eliminate common coding errors.

### Arithmetic Operators
Flint supports the following _arithmetic operators_ for all number types:
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Power (`**`)

```swift
1 + 2 // equals 3
5 - 3 // equals 2
2 * 3 // equals 6
10 / 2 // equals 5
```

#### Overflow Operators
Unlike languages such as Solidity, Flint arithmetic operators don't allow values to overflow by default. You can opt in to value overflow by using `&`

### Assignment Operators
The _assignment_ operator (`a = b`) initializes or updates the value of a with the value of b:

```swift
let b = 10
var a = 5
a = b
// a is equal to 10
```
#### Compound Assignment Operators
Flint provides _compound assignment operators_ that combine assignment (`=`) with another operator. Namely:
  - Addition Compound (`+=`)
  - Subtraction Compound (`-=`)
  - Times Compound (`*=`)
  - Division Compound (`/=`)

### Boolean Operators
These operators all result in `Bool`
- Equal to (`==`)
- Not equal to (`!=`)
- OR (`||`)
- AND (`&&`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Less than or equal to (`<=`)
- Greater than (`>`)
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`)

```swift
1 == 1   // true because 1 is equal to 1
2 != 1   // true because 2 is not equal to 1
2 > 1    // true because 2 is greater than 1
1 < 2    // true because 1 is less than 2
1 >= 1   // true because 1 is greater than or equal to 1
2 <= 1   // false because 2 is not less than or equal to 1
```

true || false // true because one of true and false is true
true && false // false because one of true and false is false

---

## Contracts
Contracts lie at the heart of Flint. These are the core building blocks of your program's code. Inside of contracts you define constants and variables to be stored on the Chain.

Contracts are declared using the keyword `contract` followed by the contract name that will be used as the identifier.

```
contract Bank {
  // Variable Declarations
  var owner: Address
  let name: String = "Bank"
}
```
### Visibility Modifiers
Variables declared in the contract can have modifiers in front of their declaration which control the automatic synthesis of variable accessors and mutators. By the nature of smart contracts all storage is visible already, but providing accessors makes that process easier.

```swift
public var value: Int
visible var name: String = Bank
visible var owner: Address
```

- `public` access synthesises an accessor and a mutator so that the storage variable can be viewed and changed by anyone.
- `visible` access synthesises an accessor to the storage variable which allows it to be viewed by anyone.
- private access means that nothing is synthesised _but_ both accessors and mutators can be manually specified.

---

## Control Flow

### For-In Loops
`for-in` loops can be used to iterate over a sequence (currently contract instance arrays and dictionary keys, and [ranges](#ranges))
```
contract X {
  var names: [String]
  var fixedLen: Int[10]
  var dictionary: [Int: String]
}
```
For example, we can iterate over a variable length array `names` and bind the current iteration's value to the constant `name` of type: `String`.
```
for let name: String in names {}
```
We can also bind the iteration's value to a variable i.e. `i`. This will allow the modification of the variable `i` inside the body - which gets reset on each loop.
```
for var i: Int in fixedLen {}
```
```
for let value: String in dictionary {}
```
### If Statements
The `if` statement has a single condition  i.e. `x == 2`. It executes a set of statements only if that condition evaluates to `true`
```swift
if x == 2 {
  // ...
}
```
#### Else Clauses
The `if` statement can also provide an alternative set of statements known as an `else` _clause_ which gets executed when the condition gets evaluated to `false`.
```swift
if x == 2 {
  // ...
} else {
  // ,,,
}
```

---

## Functions
_Functions_ are self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task, which is called using its identifier. In Flint functions cannot be overloaded and are contained within contract behaviour blocks. For more information, see [Caller Capabilities](#caller-capabilities)

They are defined with the keyword `func` followed by the identifier and the set of parameters and optional return type:
```swift
func identifier() {
  // ...
}
```

In Flint all functions are `private` by default and as such can only be accessed from within the contract body.

### Function Parameters
Functions can also take parameters which can be used within the function. Below is a function that [mutates](#mutating-modiifer) the dictionary of peoples names to add the Key, Value pair of caller's address and name. For more information about callers, see [Caller Capability Bindings](#caller-capability-bindings):
```swift
contract AddressBook {
  var people: [Address: String]
}

AddressBook :: caller <- (any) {
  mutating func remember(name: String) {
    people[caller] = name
  }
}
```

### Return Values
You can indicate the function's return type with the _return arrow_ `->`, which is followed by the return type.
```swift
AddressBook :: (any) {
  func name(address: Address) -> String {
    return people[address]
  }
}
```

### Calling Functions
Functions can then be called from within a contract behaviour block with the same identifier. For instance if we wanted to get the caller's name we can reuse the name function:
```swift
AddressBook :: caller <- (any) {
  func myName() -> String {
    return name(caller)
  }
}
```

### Function Attributes
Attributes annotate functions as having special properties, currently the only example of this is `@payable`. For more information, see [Payable](#payable).

### Function Modifiers
Functions can have any number of modifiers in front of their declaration - although conflicting modifiers will raise a compile-error and duplicated modifiers will be ignored.
#### Access Modifiers
- `public` access enables functions to be used within their contract and exposes the function to the interface of the contract as a whole when compiled.
- private access (default and not a keyword that is explicitly set) only enables functions to be used within their contract
#### Mutating Modifier
The `mutating` modifier specifies that the function mutates the contract storage. This means that the function changes the contract storage.

```swift
AddressBook :: caller <- (any) {
  func remember(name: String) { // compile-time error
    people[caller] = name // This statement is mutating
  }
}
```
```swift
AddressBook :: caller <- (any) {
  mutating func myName() -> String { // compile-time error as this function isn't mutating
    return name(caller)
  }
}
```

## Types

Flint supports the following types.

Flint is a _type-safe_ language. A type safe language encourages clarity about the type of values your code can work with.

It performs _type checks_ when compiling code and flags any mismatched types as errors. This enables you to catch and fix errors as early as possible in the development process.


### Basic Types
|Type      | Description             |
|----------|-------------------------|
|`Address` | 160-bit Ethereum Address|
|`Int`     | 256-bit integer         |
|`Bool`    | Boolean value           |
|`Void`    | Void value              |

### Arrays and Dictionaries
|Type      | Description             |
|----------|-------------------------|
| `Array` | Dynamic-size array. `[Int]` is an array of Ints |
| `Fixed-size Array` | Fixed-size memory block containing elements of the same type. `Int[10]` is an array of 10 `Int`s.         |
| `Dictionary` | Dynamic-size mappings from one key type to a value type `[Address: Bool]` is a mapping from `Address` to `Bool` |

### Ethereum-specific types
Uses cases for the following types is described into more detail in `Payable Functions and Events`.

|Type      | Description             |
|----------|-------------------------|
| `Wei` | A Wei value (the smallest denomination of Ether) |
| `Event<T...>` | An Ethereum event. Takes an arbitrary number of type arguments |

---

## Range
Flint includes two _range types_, which are shortcuts for expressing ranges of values. In particular it is designed to be used with `for-in` loops.

### Half-Open Range
The _half-open range operator_ (`a..<b`) defines a range that runs from a to b, but doesn't include b.
```swift
for let i: Int in (0..<count) {
  // ...
}
```

### Open Range
The _open range operator_ (`a..,b`) defines a range that runs from a to b and does include b.
```swift
for let i: Int in (0..<count) {
  // ...
}
```


---

## Structures
_Structures_ in Flint are general-purpose constructs that define properties and functions that can be used as self-contained blocks. They use the same syntax as defining constants and variables for properties.

### Defintion
You introduce structures with the `struct` keyword and their definition is contained within a pair of braces:
```swift
struct SomeStructure {
  // Structure definition goes here
}
```

Here is an example of a structure definition:
```swift
struct Rectangle {
  var width: Int = 0
  var height: Int = 0

  func area() -> Int {
    return width * height
  }
}
```

### Instances
The `Rectangle` structure definition describes only what a `Rectangle` would look like and what functionality they contain. They don't descibe specific rectangles. To do that you create an instance of that structure.

```swift
let someRectangle: Rectangle = Rectangle()
```

When you create an instance, you initialize that structure with it's initial values - in this case a width and height of 0. This process can also be done manually using the `init` special declaration. You can access the properties of the current structure with the special keyword `self`

```swift
struct Rectangle {
  // Same definition as above with:
  public init(width: Int, height: Int){
    self.width = width
    self.height = height
  }
}
```
### Accessing Properties/Functions
You can access properties/functions of an instance using _dot syntax_. In dot syntax, you write the property name immediately after the instance name, separated by a period (.), without any spaces.

```
someRectangle.width // evaluates to 0
someRectangle.area() // evaluates to 0 by calling the function area on the Rectangle instance someRectangle
```

In Flint, you can also access the functions of a struct using this syntax without creating an instance - as long as they don't contain instance properties. (In the future we will support the `static` keyword to do this)

```swift
struct Square {
  public shapeName() -> String {
    return "Square"
  }
}
```

```swift
Square.shapeName() // Evaluates to "Square"
```

### Reference Types in Contracts
When structures are used as variables/constants in contracts they are passed by reference. This means that the structures are not copied when assigned to a variable or constant, or when they are passed to a function. Rather than a copy, a reference to the same existing instance is used.

---

## Enumerations
An _enumeration_ defines a common group of values with the same type and enables working with those values in a type-safe way within Flint code.

### Syntax
```swift
enum CompassPoint: Int {
  case north
  case south
  case east
  case west
}
```
The values defined in an enumeration (such as `north`, `south`, `east` and `west`) are its _enumeration cases_. They are declared using the `case` keyword.

Each enumeration defines a new type:
```swift
var direction: CompassPoint
direction = CompassPoint.north
```

### Associated Values
```swift
enum Numbers: Int {
  case one = 1
  case two = 2
  case three
  case four
}
```
You can assign so called _raw values_ to enumeration cases.

Flint will infer the raw value of cases by default based upon the last declared enumeration cases raw value. `Numbers.three` will equal 3 due to this.

---

# Flint Specific Features
---

## Assets
Flint supports special safe operations when handling assets, such as Ether. They help ensure the contract's state consistently represents its Ether value, preventing attacks such as TheDAO.

The design of the Asset feature is in progress, the FIP-0001 proposal tracks its progress. At the moment, the compiler supports the Asset atomic operations for the Wei type only.

An simple use of Assets:
```swift
contract Wallet {
  var owner: Address
  var contents: Wei = Wei(0)
}

Wallet :: caller <- (any) {
  public init() {
    owner = caller
  }

  @payable
  public mutating func deposit(implicit value: Wei) {
    // Record the Wei received into the contents state property.
    // Value is passed by reference.
    contents.transfer(&value)
  }
}

Wallet :: (owner) {
  public mutating func withdraw(value: Int) {
    // Transfer an amount of Wei into a local variable. This
    // removes Wei from the contents state property.
    var w: Wei = Wei(&contents, value)

    // Send Wei to the owner's Ethereum address.
    send(owner, &w)
  }

  public func getContents() -> Int {
    return contents.getRawValue()
  }
}
```
Another example which uses Assets is the Bank example.

A more advanced use of Assets (not supported yet):
```swift
contract Wallet {
  var beneficiaries: [Address: Wei]
  var weights: [Address: Int]
  var bonus: Wei

  var owner: Address
}


Wallet :: (any) {
  @payable
  mutating func receiveBonus(implicit newBonus: inout Wei) {
    bonus.transfer(&newBonus)
  }
}

// Future syntax.
Wallet :: (owner) {
  mutating func distribute(amount: Int) {
    let beneficiaryBonus = bonus.getRawValue() / beneficiaries.count
    for i in (0..<beneficiaries.count) {
      var allocation = Wei(from: &balance, amount: amount * weights[i])
      allocation.transfer(from: &bonus, amount: beneficiaryBonus)

      send(beneficiaries[i], &allocation)
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Caller Capabilities

Flint introduces the concept of **caller capabilities**. While traditional computer programs have an entry point (the _main_ function), smart contracts do not. After a contract is deployed on the blockchain, its code does not run until an Ethereum transaction is received. Smart contracts are in fact more akin to RESTful web services presenting API endpoints. It is important to prevent unauthorized parties from calling sensitive functions.

In Flint, functions of a contract are declared within caller capability blocks, which restrict which users/contracts are allowed to call the enclosed functions.
```swift
// Only the manager of the Bank can call "clear".
Bank :: (manager) { // manager is a state property.
  func clear(address: Address) {
    // body
  }
}
```
Caller capabilities can be any property declared in the contract's declaration, as long as their type is `Address` or `[Address]`.

Note: The special caller capability any allows `any` caller to execute the function in the group.

Calls to Flint functions are validated both at compile-time and runtime.

---

### Static checking
In a Flint function, if a function call to another Flint function is performed, the compiler checks that the caller has sufficient caller capabilities.

Consider the following example.

```swift
Bank :: (any) {
  func foo() {
    // Error: Capability "any" cannot be used to perform a call to a
    // function for "manager"
    bar()
  }
}

Bank :: (manager) {
  func bar() {}
}
```
Within the context of `foo`, the caller is regarded as any. It is not certain that the caller also has capability manager, so the compiler rejects the call.

---
### Dynamic checking
#### Attempt function calls
It is still possible for the caller of `bar` to have the capability `manager`.

For these cases, two additional language constructs exist:

- `try? bar()`: The function `bar`'s body is executed if at runtime, the caller's capability matches `bar`'s. The expression `try? bar()` returns a boolean.
- `try! bar()`: If at runtime, the caller's capability doesn't match `manager`, an exception is thrown and the body doesn't get executed. Otherwise, it does.

Note: this is not supported by the compiler yet.

#### Calls from Ethereum users or non-Flint smart contracts
Functions to contracts on the Blockchain can also be called by users directly, through an Ethereum client, or another non-Flint smart contract.

For those cases, Flint checks at runtime whether the caller has the appropriate capabilities to perform the call, and throws an exception if not.

#### Multiple capabilities
A contract behavior declaration can be restricted by multiple caller capabilities.

Consider the following contract behavior declaration:
```
Bank :: (manager, accounts) {
  func forManagerOrCustomers() {}
}
```
The function `forManagerOrCustomers` can only be called by either the manager, or any of the accounts registered in the bank.

Calls to functions of multiple capabilities are accepted if **each** of the capabilities of the enclosing function are compatible with **any** of the target function's capabilities.

Consider the following examples:

#### Insufficient capabilities
```swift
Bank :: (manager, accounts) {
  func forManagerOrCustomers() {
    // Error: "accounts" is not compatible with "manager"
    forManager()
  }
}

Bank :: (manager) {
  func forManager() {}
}
```
#### Sufficient capabilities
```swift
Bank :: (manager, accounts) {
  func forManagerOrCustomers() {
    // Valid: "manager" is compatible with "manager", and "accounts" is
    // compatible with "accounts"
    forManagerOrCustomers2()
  }
}

Bank :: (accounts, manager) {
  func forManagerOrCustomers2() {}
}
```
#### `any` is compatible with any capability
```swift
Bank :: (manager, accounts) {
  func forManagerOrCustomers() {
    // Valid: "manager" is compatible with "manager" (and "any", too), and "accounts"
    // is compatible with "any"
    forManagerOrCustomers2()
  }
}

// The caller capability "manager" has no effect: "any" is compatible with any capability
Bank :: (manager, any) {
  func forManagerOrCustomers2() {}
}
```
#### Static and dynamic checking
Just like single-capability definitions, capability lists are checked both at compile-time and runtime.

### Capability Binding
Capabilities can be bound to temporary variables.

Consider the following example.
```swift
Bank :: account <- (accounts) {
  // This function is non-mutating
  public func getBalance() -> Int {
    return balances[account]
  }

  public mutating func transfer(amount: Int, destination: Address) {
    balances[account] -= amount
    balances[destination] += amount
  }
}
```
`withdraw` can be called by any caller which has an account in the bank. The caller's address is bound to the variable `account`, which can then be used in the body of the functions.


---

## Payable
On Ethereum, function calls to other contracts (i.e., "transactions") can be attached with an amount of Wei (the smallest denomination of Ether). Such functions are called "payable". The target account is then credited with the attached amount.

Functions in Flint can be marked as payable using the `@payable` attribute. The amount of Wei sent is bound to an implicit variable:
```swift
@payable
public func receiveMoney(implicit value: Wei) {
  doSomething(value)
}
```
Payable functions may have an arbitrary amount of parameters, but exactly one needs to be implicit and of a currency type.

---

## Events
JavaScript applications can listen to events emitted by an Ethereum smart contract.

In Flint, events are declared in contract declarations. The `Event` type takes generic arguments, corresponding to the types of values attached to the event.
```swift
contract Bank {
  var balances: [Address: Int]
  var didCompleteTransfer: Event<Address, Address, Int> // (origin, destination, amount)
}

Bank :: caller <- (any) {
  mutating func transfer(destination: Address, amount: Int) {
    balances[caller] -= amount
    balances[destination] += amount

    // A JavaScript client could listen for this event
    didCompleteTransfer(caller, destination, amount)
  }
}
```


---

## Type States
Flint introduces the concept of **type states**. Insufficient and incorrect state management in Solidity code have led to security vulnerabilities and unexpected behaviour in widely deployed smart contracts. Avoiding these vulnerabilities by the design of the language is a strong advantage.

In Flint, states of a contract are declared within capability blocks, which restrict which users/contracts are allowed to call the enclosed functions.
```swift
// Ahyone can deposit into the Bank iff the state is Deposit
Bank @(Deposit) :: (any) { // Deposit is a state identifier.
  func deposit(address: Address) {
    // body
  }
}
```
States are identifiers declared in the contract's declaration.
```swift
contract Auction (Preparing, InProgress, Terminated) {}
// Preparing, InProgress, Terminated are State Identifiers
```

Note: The special state identifier `any` allows execution of the function in the group in any state.

Calls to Flint functions are validated both at compile-time and runtime.

```swift
contract Auction (Preparing, InProgress, Terminated) { // Enumeration of states.
  var beneficiary: Address
  var highestBidder: Address
  var highestBid: Wei
}

Auction @(any) :: caller <- (any) {
  public init() {
    self.beneficiary = caller
    self.highestBidder = caller
    self.highestBid = Wei(0)
    become Preparing
  }
}

Auction @(Preparing) :: (beneficiary) {
  public mutating func setBeneficiary(beneficiary: Address) {
    self.beneficiary = beneficiary
  }

  mutating func openAuction() -> Bool {
    // ...
    return true
    become InProgress
  }
}
Auction @(InProgress) :: (beneficiary) {

  mutating func endAuction() {
    // ...
    become Terminated
  }
}

## Assertion
Assertions are checks that happen at runtime. They are used to ensure an essential condition is satisfied before executing any further code. If the Boolean condition evaluates to true then the execution continues as usual. Otherwise the transaction is reverted.
It is a global function accessible from any contract or contract group:
```
assert(x == 2)
```

In essence an assertion is a shorthand for the longer:
```
if x == 2 {
  fatalError()
}
```
## Fatal Error
`fatalError()` is a function exposed that reverts a transaction when called. This means that any contract storage changes are rolledback and no values are returned.

## Bank Smart Contract
The following code declares the Bank contract and its functions. More examples are available on GitHub.

```swift
// Contract declarations contain only their state properties.
contract Bank {
  var manager: Address
  var balances: [Address: Wei] = [:]
  var accounts: [Address] = []
  var lastIndex: Int = 0

  var totalDonations: Wei = Wei(0)
  var didCompleteTransfer: Event<Address, Address, Int>
}

// The functions in this block can be called by any user.
Bank :: account <- (any) {
  public init(manager: Address) {
    self.manager = manager
  }

  // Returns the manager's address.
  public mutating func register() {
    accounts[lastIndex] = account
    lastIndex += 1
  }

  public func getManager() -> Address {
    return manager
  }

  @payable
  public mutating func donate(implicit value: Wei) {
    // This will transfer the funds into totalDonations.
    totalDonations.transfer(&value)
  }
}

// Only the manager can call these functions.
Bank :: (manager) {

  // This function needs to be declared "mutating" as its body mutates
  // the contract's state.
  public mutating func freeDeposit(account: Address, amount: Int) {
    var w: Wei = Wei(amount)
    balances[account].transfer(&w)
  }

  public mutating func clear(account: Int) {
    balances[account] = Wei(0)
  }

  // This function is non-mutating.
  public func getDonations() -> Int {
    return totalDonations.getRawValue()
  }
}

// Any user in accounts can call these functions.
// The matching user's address is bound to the variable account.
Bank :: account <- (accounts) {
  public func getBalance() -> Int {
    return balances[account].getRawValue()
  }

  public mutating func transfer(amount: Int, destination: Address) {
    // Transfer Wei from one account to another. The balances of the
    // originator and the destination are updated atomically.
    // Crashes if balances[account] doesn't have enough Wei.
    balances[destination].transfer(&balances[account], amount)

    // Emit the Ethereum event.
    didCompleteTransfer(account, destination, amount)
  }

  public mutating func withdraw(amount: Int) {
    // Transfer some Wei from balances[account] into a local variable.
    let w: Wei = Wei(&balances[account], amount)

    // Send the amount back to the Ethereum user.
    send(account, &w)
  }
}
```
