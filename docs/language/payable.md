# Payable Functions and Events
Flint supports special Ethereum-specific features.
---
## Payable
On Ethereum, function calls to other contracts (i.e., "transactions") can be attached with an amount of Wei (the smallest denomination of Ether). Such functions are called "payable". The target account is then credited with the attached amount.

Functions in Flint can be marked as payable using the `@payable` attribute. The amount of Wei sent is bound to an implict variable:
```swift
@payable
public func receiveMoney(implicit value: Wei) {
  doSomething(value)
}
```
Payable functions may have an arbitrary amount of parameters, but exactly one needs to be implicit and of a currency type.

## Events
JavaScript applications can listen to events emitted by an Ethereum smart contract.

In Flint, events are declared in contract declarations. The `Event` type takes generic arguments, corresponding to the types of values attached to the event.
```swift
contract Bank {
  var balances: [Address: Int]
  var didCompleteTransfer: Event<Address, Address, Int> // (origin, destination, amount)
}
​
Bank :: caller <- (any) {
  mutating func transfer(destination: Address, amount: Int) {
    balances[caller] -= amount
    balances[destination] += amount
​
    // A JavaScript client could listen for this event
    didCompleteTransfer(caller, destination, amount)
  }
}
```
